# Screen-Projection-using-Face-Recognition

This application is a Face Tracking API that should be able to track the presenter's face when he/she comes in contact with the light that's being projected to the screen from the projector.
This application creates a dark spot (or a spot of no light) where the user can present the topic without strong projector lights blinding his/her eyes.
